  Calculate User Metrics: The analysis aimed to understand website usage patterns, including how frequently people visit the website, the number of daily sessions, the average session duration, and user retention rate. This was achieved by grouping users based on their initial visit date to create a controlled group, allowing for the examination of these usage metrics over time. 

Calculate Sales Metrics: The analysis focused on understanding user behavior, specifically when they make their first purchase from their initial visit, the number of orders they place within a specified timeframe, their average order size, and the revenue they generate. This was achieved by grouping users' first orders and calculating the subsequent orders made within a set time period. Additionally, the average purchase value was computed for each user, allowing the determination of their Lifetime Value (LTV).

Calculate Marketing Metrics: The goal was to assess spending per source and over time, determine the cost of customer acquisition from each source, and evaluate the overall return on investment. This involved tracking total expenditures from different sources over time, grouping orders by source to calculate total revenue and costs for each source (identifying those with the lowest and highest Customer Acquisition Cost or CAC), and analyzing return on investment by grouping users based on their source, Lifetime Value (LTV), and CAC to determine when each source became profitable.
